# Scott Petrovic blog

This is a personal blog. It is built using Hugo. Hugo is a static site generator that is really fast.

## Dependencies

- Go: Used for hugo buiding
- Hugo: Command line tool used to build project

## Building and launching

Open the root location in something like Visual Studio Code. Open the command prompt up and type the following:

    hugo server -D

This will build and run the project under a localhost. Hugo also has a watch process, so changes that are done will be updated. The -D flag includes posts that are marked as drafts

## Adding or editing posts

Add a new MD file to the content > posts area. See other markdown files for reference.
